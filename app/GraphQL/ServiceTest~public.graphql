        ```
    2. Redirect the User to `url`
    3. After successful Sign In the User will come back and Client should call
    `authorize` mutation with `code` and `state` to finish the authorization:
        ```graphql
        mutation {
            auth {
                organization(id) {
                    authorize(input: {code: "...", state: "..."}) {

                }
            }
        }
        ```
    4. Check result:
    - `result = false` -> something wrong, please try to repeat step (1)
    - `me.enabled = false` -> user disabled or doesn't have access to the
    Organization. In this case, the Client should allow the User to
    Sign Out (so the User may repeat auth process if it want).
